## Overview and History of R

  - R is a dialect of the S language.
  - S is a language that was developed by John Chambers and others at Bell Labs. S was initiated in 1976
  - R was created in 1991 – by Rose Ihaka and Robert Gentleman
  - In 1993 R was released to the public. 1997: R core group was formed 2000: R 1.0.0 was released
  - We are using R version 3.1.2 (2014-10-31) 


##Features of R
 - Runs on almost any standard computing platform/OS (even on the PlayStation 3)
 - Frequent releases (annual + bug_x releases); active development.
 - Useful for interactive work, but contains a powerful programming language for developing new tools (user --> programmer)



##Feature of R
 - Very active and vibrant user community; R-help and R-devel mailing lists and Stack Overflow – look at them on when at R help
 - It's free! (Both in the sense of beer and in the sense of speech.)

  
## Setup Environment
 - Download  R from - The Comprehensive R Archive Network -http://cran.r-project.org/ and R Studio 
  - Available for the key OS \newline
  
 **R-studio?**
 -RStudio is the premier integrated development environment for R. - Download and install from http://www.rstudio.com/

**Why R-studio?**
 - RStudio's source editor includes a variety of productivity enhancing features including syntax highlighting, code completion, multiple-file editing, and find/replace, retrieving prev commands

## Types of people in the world

 - *There are **10 types of people** in this world, those who understand binary and those who dont*

## The Terms

  - **Object** R is an object oriented language and everything in R is an object. 
      - We store using <- or = operator ie  x <- 3 | x=3
  - **Vector** A collection of one or more objects of the same type . We use c() or vector()
  - **Function** A set of instructions carried out on one or more objects.
    - function *mean()* is used to calculate the arithmetic mean
  - **Operator** Is a symbol that has a pre-defined meaning. +\*-/
  - **Parameter** The kind of information that can be passed to a function – mean(age)

## Packages

  - A set of functions designed to perform more specific statistical or graphical tasks examples and documentation.
  - 4000+ packages found on the CRAN
  - To use packages in R, we must first install them using the install.packages()

## Data Types / Classes

  
Data Types          | Stores                    | 
--------------------|---------------------------|
real                | floating point numbers    | 
integer             | integers                  |
complex             | Complex numbers           |
factor              | categorical data          | 
character           | strings                   | 
logical             | TRUE or FALSe             | 
NA                  | Missing                   |
NULL                | Empty                     |
Function            | Function type             | 
--------------------|------------------------------

## RStudio Platform
![RSTUDIO](rstudio.png)

## Vector

- A vector can only contain objects of the same class

```{r }
a <- c(1,2,5.3,6,-2,4) # numeric vector
b <- c("one","two","three") # character vector
c <- c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE) #logical vector
```

## Matrices

  - All columns in a matrix must have the same class(numeric, character, etc.) and the same length. The general format is
```{r }
   #     mymatrix <- matrix(vector, nrow=r, ncol=c, byrow=FALSE,
      #     dimnames=list(char_vector_rownames, char_vector_colnames)) 
 #    byrow=TRUE indicates that the matrix should be filled by rows
```

## Factors
 - Used to represent categorical data. 
 - Can be unordered or ordered.
    -A factor is like an integer vector where each integer has a label.
```{r }
  x <- factor(c("yes", "yes", "no", "yes", "no"))
  x
```



## Missing Values
 - Missing values are represented by the symbol **NA** (not available)
 - Impossible values (e.g., dividing by zero) are represented by the symbol NaN (not a number)

 - Can be unordered or ordered.
    -A factor is like an integer vector where each integer has a label.
```{r }
  x <- NA
 # is.na(x) # returns TRUE of x is missing
# mean(x, na.rm=TRUE) # exclude missing in functions
# complete.cases() #returns the number of complete cases

```

## Data Frames

 - More general than a matrix, has different columns and can have different modes (numeric, character, factor, etc.)
 - Used to store tabular data
 - Can store data of different classes
 - *read.table()* or *read.csv()* – used to load dataframes
 
## Create Data Frames
```{r }
data.frame(foo = 1:4, bar = c(T, T, F, F))
x <- c(1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
y <- c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i")
df <- data.frame(x=x, y=y)
```


* * *
```{r }
print(df)
class(df)
```


## Datasets

- R works with different types of datasets 
- Base R functions *read.table* and *read.csv* can read in data stored as text files, delimited by *almost anything* 
- Data from other stat packages can be read using  *foreign package?*  \newline
  *read.xlsx(file, sheetIndex=1) #excel files* \newline
  *read.dta(file)# stata files*

## .RDA Data 
 - R Data type
 - Can be created from other data sets 
    -data <- load("profit.rda") 
    -Saving a data frame as an rda
   - Save(data.frame, “dataset.rda”) 
   

## Creating an analysis project - Ideal Way

 - Using R Studio to create a Project  - From an existing directory
